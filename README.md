# Brain_tumors-Fastrcnn_pfn
Brain tumor detector using the Roboflow dataset https://universe.roboflow.com/test-svk7h/brain-tumors-detection/dataset/2 as training dataset and simple programs generated by querying Bing's AI. It requires very few resources and can be run on a personal computer.

Installation:

If not already installed, the following programs are required:

pip install torch

pip install torchvision

pip install requests

pip install packaging

pip install pyparsing

pip install cycler

pip install python-dateutil (NOTE: NOT dateutil)

pip install kiwisolver

pip install importlib_resources

Download the project files to your hard drive. In that folder, download the COCO JSON version of the file https://universe.roboflow.com/test-svk7h/brain-tumors-detection/dataset/2 as a .zip file and extract it.

Training:

Run the program:

python train.py

It comes ready to produce a model: fasterrcnn_fpn.pth, which produces satisfactory results with only 5 epochs.

Checking results:

python test.py
